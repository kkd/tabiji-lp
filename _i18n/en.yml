appname: "Tabiji - Travel Journal App"
catchcopy: "To make traveling memories easier, delightful. Enrich your life through traveling."
vision: Vision
concept: "Tabiji (tabiji is Japanese, '旅'(tabi) means jouney, '路'(ji) means 'the way') is a journey recording app aiming to make traveling more enjoyable, focusing on traveling.  Because I want to make my travel more valuable, I will not dare to use SNS like applications. I do not fully automate because I would like to have my journey memorized more.  However, Tabiji is responsible for troublesome things.  Why do not you leave a record for yourself after returning home from the extra time?  It is not a trip to see just the smartphone, but I want you to look at the actual travel destination and feel it. <br> We plan and develop such a thing in hope."
